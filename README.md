# webpack-split-chunks-test

## Setup

`yarn && yarn build && yarn serve`

## Bundle One Css File

It's expected, and the color is green

## Split CSS Chunks (uncomment the comment in webpack.config.js)

The color is red, the css chunks inserted into the html are not the same as the ones in the bundle
